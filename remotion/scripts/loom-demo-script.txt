LOOM DEMO — 5 MINUTE VOICEOVER SCRIPT
======================================

[0:00–0:45] CHAPTER 1: THE PROBLEM
"Hey — thanks for taking a few minutes to watch this.

If you're running a personal injury firm, I want to show you something
most marketing agencies don't want you to think about.

Your intake team is probably spending hours every week
on people who were never real leads to begin with.

Shared lead services? You're one of five firms
calling the same person within the first hour.

And pay-per-click? You're buying clicks.
Not cases. Not signed clients. Clicks.

There's a better way. Let me show you."

[0:45–2:00] CHAPTER 2: HOW SETTLEMENT SAM WORKS
"Settlement Sam is a lead qualification system built specifically
for personal injury attorneys.

Here's how it works from the consumer side.

Someone is injured. They search for help.
They find our quiz — it takes about three minutes to complete.

We ask twelve qualification questions:
What type of injury? Were you at fault? Did you have surgery?
Were you hospitalized? Did you miss work?

Every answer goes into their profile.

Then — and this is the key step — we verify their phone number via SMS.

They don't get their case estimate until they've confirmed
it's really them. That alone eliminates the fake submissions
and tire-kickers that waste your team's time."

[2:00–3:00] CHAPTER 3: LEAD QUALITY
"Here's what you actually receive.

Not a name and a phone number.

A full injury profile.

Take Sarah — a real example, anonymized.
Spinal injury. Surgery confirmed. Three-day hospitalization.
Fifteen thousand in lost wages. Insurance has already been contacted.
SMS verified. Estimated case value: seventy-five to two hundred thousand dollars.

That's what lands in your inbox or CRM.

Every single lead in your batch has completed this process.
No exceptions."

[3:00–4:00] CHAPTER 4: EXCLUSIVITY AND GUARANTEE
"Now let's talk about what makes this genuinely different.

When you purchase a twenty-five-lead access pass,
those leads are yours — exclusively — for ninety days.

No other firm in your geography is receiving this lead.
You're not racing anyone to the phone.

And if a lead's number is disconnected or unreachable?
We replace it. No questions. Hundred percent replacement guarantee.

Leads are delivered in real time — straight to your CRM or email —
the moment they complete verification."

[4:00–5:00] CHAPTER 5: THE CLOSE
"Here's the summary.

Twenty-five verified, profiled, exclusive leads.
One signed case at a four percent conversion rate.
Average case value: fifty thousand dollars.

Your investment: sixty-two fifty.
Your return: eight hundred percent.

We work first-come, first-served by geography.
When your territory is claimed, it's closed.

Twenty-five lead minimum. No contracts.
If a lead doesn't answer, we replace it.

Thank you for watching."
