FULL PITCH — 90 SECOND VOICEOVER SCRIPT
=========================================
(Meta ad / Attorney page hero)

[0:00–0:05] PATTERN INTERRUPT
"Stop paying for effort."

[pause — 2 seconds]

"Start paying for outcomes."

[0:05–0:20] PROBLEM AGITATION
"The average PI firm spends eight thousand dollars a month on marketing.
Less than three percent of those leads become signed cases.
Most leads are shared with five or more competing firms.
And you don't know what you're getting until it's too late."

[0:20–0:40] THE SOLUTION
"Settlement Sam is different.

Every lead is SMS-verified — a real human who confirmed their identity.
Every lead comes with a full injury profile — pre-screened across twelve questions.
And every lead is yours exclusively for ninety days.
No other firm in your geography touches it."

[0:40–0:65] SOCIAL PROOF + ECONOMICS
"Here's what a Settlement Sam lead looks like:
Spinal injury. Surgery confirmed. Phone verified.
Estimated case value: seventy-five to two hundred thousand dollars.

Invest sixty-two fifty in a batch of twenty-five.
Sign one case — which is a four percent conversion, the conservative average.
That's eight hundred percent ROI.

One case. Covers your investment eight times over."

[0:65–0:80] URGENCY
"We fill territories first-come, first-served.
Right now, ten states are open.
When your state fills — it closes."

[0:80–0:90] CTA
"Twenty-five lead minimum. No contracts. Replace any bad lead.

Secure your territory at settlementsam.com slash attorneys."

DELIVERY NOTES:
- Open cold. Dead air before line 1 — let the silence work.
- Lines 1-2: slow, deliberate. Not a pitch. A statement.
- Problem section: factual, not alarmed. Like reading a report.
- Solution: pick up energy slightly — this is the relief.
- ROI numbers: confident, not excited. The confidence IS the pitch.
- CTA: clear, clean, no rush. End on "attorneys" cleanly.
