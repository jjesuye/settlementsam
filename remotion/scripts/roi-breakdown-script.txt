ROI BREAKDOWN — 45 SECOND VOICEOVER SCRIPT
==========================================

[0:00–0:05]
"Let me show you the unit economics of a two-hundred-fifty-dollar lead.
This is math most attorneys have never been shown."

[0:05–0:15]
"Twenty-five leads. Two-fifty each.
Six thousand two hundred fifty dollars invested.

At a four percent conversion rate — and that's conservative —
you sign one case."

[0:15–0:30]
"The average personal injury case value?
Fifty thousand dollars. Often much higher.

Do the math: that's an eight-hundred-percent return on investment.
On a single batch."

[0:30–0:40]
"Compare that to the traditional agency model —
three thousand a month retainer, six to twelve month contracts,
no performance guarantee, and you own nothing.

With Settlement Sam: fixed cost, no monthly fees,
ninety-day exclusivity, and you own every piece of data."

[0:40–0:45]
"One signed case from twenty-five leads
covers your entire investment eight times over.
Secure your geography today."

DELIVERY NOTES:
- Tone: CFO-style. Analytical. Let math speak.
- Slow down on the numbers — let viewers read along.
- "eight hundred percent" — say it clean, no excitement needed. The number sells itself.
